# Dicey!

## Introduction

Dicey is a web-based die rolling application for use in tabletop roleplaying games.

The primary design focus is to have dicey running on your mobile phone, and you use it as a replacement for physical dice.

* Fits well with my group's Use Cases.

* Use ReactJS for composing the application.
* Use some new tools for learnin' new things.
